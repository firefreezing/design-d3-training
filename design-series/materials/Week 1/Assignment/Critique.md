# Assignment 1

### **Instruction:**

In this folder, you will find three data visualizations. Review each one and use what you have learned about data visualization design principles to come up with 5-10 notes about aspects of the visualization that you think are either good or bad (as many in each category as you feel is appropriate). In addition, come up with your own design for a visualization that displays the same data. Submit your design as a rough sketch or mock-up exported from a piece of drawing or design software. Also write a couple of sentences on why you think that your design effectively presents the data.


### **Submission:**
1. Evaluation on current visualizations:
    - `Viz 1.png`
        + Pros:
            - tried to illustrate total and subgroups
            - tried to illustrate 2-dimensional data in one graph
        + Cons:
            - too much information filled in one graph without a clear story focus
            - color choices are not eye friendly
            - the y labels are unclear, better to add unit/scale (e.g. $, thousands, etc.) Currently, I treat the left y axis presents the total sales value for each product, and the right axis shows the total sales value
    - `Viz 2.png`
        +   Cons:
            - low resolution is the No.1 issue of this visualization
            - too much information illustrated without clear focus
            - labels of bars are convoluted but not represent independent categories
            - unclear what the boxed %s stand for, hard to track the pattern (red stands for overall change, and blue for one particular subgroup? Then why that subgroup)
            - color choices are not appealing

    - `Viz 3.jpg`
        +   Pros:
            - tried to present key statistics in a concise fashion
        +   Cons:
            - misleading to present %s with overlaps on one entity in a non-overlapping fashion
            - size of area is not proportional to actual %. (*Even it is propotional, it is still challenging for audience to measure ununiform shapes*)
            - the statistics seem be collected from a survey, but the supporting narratives regarding "tech-savvy" and "creative" are not so clearly laid out. Why other features do not have similar narrative? 

2. My alternate designs:
    - `Alt 1.[ext]`: I designed a stacked bar chart, sorted by total sales amount (in $). 
    - `Alt 2.[ext]`: Since it is really hard to capture the main message of this visualization, I cannot provide an alternative solution. Some suggestions to the original vis:
        + consider group/cluster some subgroups (currently there are 27 subgroups)
        + consider break one graph into multiple panels if the relation between bars are not the main focus
        + if the changes are the main focus, consider a paired stack bar charts in each panel, to show the case count before & after 

    - `Alt 3.[ext]`: I designed a simple sorted bar chart to illustrate how baby boomers describe themselves, by popularity. 


### Notes
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is a very useful tool for creating mock-ups
    +  Figma is so powerful, but apparently I need more time to even be able to master some very basic (and super handy) functionalities. Can we have some future classes to give a quick walk through on how to use this tool efficiently for prototyping? (well, I realized that I need to do my 1 hour homework on YouTube search & watch before this ask)
